# Batch-
Batch++ is a mix of Batch and C#, anything you can do in C# you can do here, anything in batch you can do here, many commands are from batch, the Syntax is very similar to batch.  The grammer is all from C#, functions are also in this ( so basicly Batch but better, thats why it is called Batch Plus Plus )
